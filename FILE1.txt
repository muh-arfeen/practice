The Information Strategy Committee (PIA) has produced a Code of Practice Note for appointing “custodians” for every computer connected to the UCL network. Custodians are responsible for ensuring all computers in their estate are kept secure and meet the requirements of the UCL Information Security Policy. (Details of the Code of Practice is available on the UCL’s Security Team’s website).

The following is a summarised list of actions that custodians must take to safeguard computer systems; detailed information is available in the ISC Code of Practice:
